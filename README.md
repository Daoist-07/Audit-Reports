# Solidity Audit Report Findings — by 0xGutzzz

Welcome to my Solidity audit findings repository! 🛡️  
I’m **0xGutzzz**, and this repo serves as a collection of vulnerabilities, best practices, and insights I’ve gathered while auditing smart contracts. My goal is to help developers, auditors, and security researchers better understand common pitfalls in Solidity projects and learn how to avoid them.
